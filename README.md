# Forest-Fire-Bayesian-Analysis

Bayesian analysis of Forest Fire Data. 

Forest fires are a major environmental issue, creating economical and ecological damage while endangering human lives. Fast detection is a key element for controlling such phenomenon. To achieve this, one alternative is to use automatic tools based on local sensors, such as provided by meteorological stations.

We aim to find a model useful to evaluate the probability of fires in different areas and
with different climate conditions.
